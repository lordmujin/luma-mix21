# Hypixel Skyblock Resource Pack for Minecraft 1.21
![banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1331864-6dd2-4d7c-91df-06dacd5189b6)
Hello every-nyan <3 

This pack is based on the new Firmament mod CIT format using the fabric modloader, I advise some mods like Sodium and Indium for performance and I'll leave links down bellow.
I have been searching the web for the past few weeks and still couldn't find much info on new packs for 1.21, skyblocker and firmament already updated, with really good features for the server, but we still don't have a texture pack that works, so I started doing one :)

## Disclaimer
### The textures are not made by me, the original packs are linked bellow
### I take this as a community project, if more people start doing their thing, we can have so much more options on texture packs, specially for 1.21

## W.I.P
### -Armor *Models* is not implemented yet, so only items work
### -Icons and arrows in GUI's
### -Potions

## Future
### This is a personal project, I'll do some work when I can, I do want to understand better and learn this new way of making textures, specially through the new CIT system.
### I am very happy to contribute to the hypixel skyblock community, probably my fav server ever, and I'm doing this to any skyblock player that wants to try the new ways of playing.

### Feel free to let me know opinions and if I could be doing something better, I am posting this hoping the community will turn to 1.21 and we can work on something new, a lot better for performance, and smoother overall.

### This is almost a basic wiki to get into Hypixel 1.21, I wish I found something like this, hopefully is usefull for you <3
