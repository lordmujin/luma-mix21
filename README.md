## Hypixel Skyblock Resource Pack for Minecraft 1.21

This is my first try of a texture pack for Hypixel Skyblock on Minecraft 1.21.

It requires Firmament to work, and I advise some mods like Sodium and Indium for performance, I'll leave links down bellow.
I have been searching the web for the past few weeks and still couldn't get the armor models to work, but we can do items, this is still very new and there is almost no info on how we should proceed.

I have another mix for minecraft 1.20.4, it uses CIT and optifine components, but it hasn't seen an update in months, and honestly I dont think CIT will save us, we gotta start adapting to the new layout, wich will be a pain to rework, but I think it will be worth it.

Feel free to let me know opinions and if I could be doing something better, I am posting this hoping the community will turn to 1.21 and we can work on something new, a lot better for performance, and smoother overall.

This is almost a basic wiki to get into Hypixel 1.21, I wish I found something like this, hopefully is usefull for you <3
